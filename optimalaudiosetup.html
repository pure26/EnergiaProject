    <b>Tip</b>
    <p>
      You can select different devices for microphone and speakers under each
      section. But to avoid echoing, it is better to use the same device for
      both. If you have to use separate devices, minimize echoing by lowering
      your speaker's volume.

    <h1>Optimizing your Audio</h1>
    <h2>Check Call Quality</h2>
    <p>
      Before you start a Skype for Business meeting or call, make sure your
      audio device sounds the way you want. Note that<b> Check Call Quality</b>
      may not be available for your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. On the lower-left side of the main Skype for Business window, click<b>
        Select Primary Device.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      2.<b> Click Check Call Quality</b> and follow the prompts to record a
      short message and play it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. If you’re not happy with the audio quality, go to<b>
        Audio Device Settings</b
      >
      to adjust your mic and speakers, or select another device.
    </p>
    <h2>Use a Headset</h2>
    <p>
      A headset provides two benefits: clarity and privacy. A headset microphone
      will pick up more of your voice and less of your surroundings than your
      computer's built-in microphone, and the earpiece(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensure that you use a<b> USB dedicated headset,</b> you may order a
      headset from the section above<a href="#"> here.</a>
    </p>
    <b>Tip</b>
    <p>
      Users should be aware that the headset connected through<b>
        USB port is recommended</b
      >
      over the one connected through the Headphone and Microphone ports since
      the latter sometimes is not compatible with Skype for Business
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="" />
    <p>
      If your device has more than one set of inputs/outputs (built in
      mic/speakers, headset, external mic, etc.), take a moment to confirm that
      you are using your intended microphone and speakers.
    </p>
    <h2>Avoid echoing</h2>
    <p>
      If you are in a room with other participants who are attending the same
      Skype for Business meeting, and you are not using headsets, make sure the
      meeting's audio is only turned on for one of you. This will help eliminate
      disruptive echo and feedback. Using a headset or lowering the volume of
      your speakers/microphone can help avoid echoing issues.
    </p>
    <h2>Check Mute Button</h2>
    <p>
      Skype for Business mutes your microphone when you first join a meeting, so
      you'll need to remember to unmute yourself when you want to speak. Muting
      your microphone cuts down on background noise, keyboard clacking, and
      other distractions. All Skype for Business clients have an on-screen mute
      control. Users also can press<b> Windows Key + F4</b> to mute/unmute
      themselves. Meeting organizers and presenters have the ability to mute
      individual participants or the entire audience if necessary.
