						<h2>Meetings</h2>
					 <h3>Managing Meetings </h3>
			<p>Skype for Business lets you conduct audio, video, and web conferencing on the go. You can
easily plan an online meeting well in advance, in addition to hosting one in real time. As
many as 250 people can join a meeting with their individual devices.</p>
		<h3>Schedule a Meeting</h3>
		<h3>Schedule a Meeting in Outlook</h3>
	<p>Skype for Business can be easily integrated with the Outlook plugin. This allows you to
schedule your online meetings through Outlook with a single click. The presenter can choose
a meeting topic and can also determine which participants can join the meeting. The details
and information for a particular meeting or conference call are available on the Outlook
template.	</p>

					<ul>
					<li>Open your Outlook Calendar, click the Home tab, and click New Skype Meeting.</li>
					<li> Complete the meeting request just like you normally would.</li>
				  </ul>

 	<h3>Set Meeting Options	</h3>
<p>You can set some meeting options in Outlook before you even send the meeting request,
like who will be able to get into the meeting directly and who waits in the virtual lobby.</p>
