        <p><b>First Solution: </b></p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the default software for making calls for the device is
          still set as “eSpace” and not “Lync”. To check go to “regedit” >
          HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IM Providers. If the value for
          “DefaultIMApp is “eSpace then set it to “Lync”. After that, restart
          both Outlook and Skype. If it is already set to “Lync” then try the
          second solution below.
        </p>
        <img src="./img/nfaq39.png" alt="nfaq39" />
        <p><b>Second Solution: </b></p>
        <p>Kill both Outlook and Skype.</p>
        <p>
          Then go again to the “regedit” and delete the user’s registry key
          under
          HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\firstname.lastname@aramco.com
        </p>
        <p>After that open Outlook then Skype (in that order).</p>

        <h3><u>Frequent call disconnection: </u></h3>
        <p><b>Solution 1 </b></p>
        <p>
          The main cause of this issue is when there is more than one user
          logged in to the same machine. If the user who is in the background
          left Skype logged in before switching to the other user, the other
          user will experience frequent disconnection in Skype calls roughly
          every 20-30 seconds. Quick way to solve this issue is to ask the user
          to restart his machine to force the user in the background to be
          killed.
        </p>
        <p>To check if there is another user on the background go to</p>
        <p>

        <h3><u>Questions about contacts</u></h3>
        <h3>How do I add an internal contact to my Contacts list?</h3>
        <p>1. In the Skype4B main window, click the Add a Contact button.</p>
        <p>
          2. From the dropdown menu, click Add a Contact in my Organization.

        <p>
          In the search field on the Skype4B main window, type the name, email
          address, or phone number of the person you are looking for.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I block contacts from reaching me via Skype4B?</h3>
        <p>
          Although your name and email address are displayed to blocked
          contacts, they can’t reach you through Skype4B. To block a contact in
          Skype4B:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Right-click the contact you want to block, click Change Privacy
          Relationship, and then click Blocked Contacts.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I display only those contacts who are online?</h3>
        <p>
          Although you can’t completely remove offline contacts from your
          contacts list, you can send them to a separate group so they don’t
          clutter it up. Click Options->Contacts List and then select the
          checkbox labeled Show contacts with away, offline and unknown
          presences in a separate group. Unavailable contacts will now appear at
          the bottom of the display, in a group called Away and Offline
          Contacts.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I delete contacts from my Contacts list?</h3>
        <p>
          Right-click the contact you want to delete, and then click Remove from
          Contacts List.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I create a group?</h3>
        <p>
          1. In the Skype4B main window, on your Contacts list, right-click any
          group name (for example, Other Contacts), then click Create New Group.
          Or click the Add a Contact button, and then click Create a New Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the space that now opens up at the bottom of the window, type
          over the phrase New Group to give your group a descriptive name.
        </p>
        <h3>How many contacts can I have?</h3>
        <p>
          The default maximum number of contacts that can be added is 1000. But
          your actual limit is set by your support team, so contact them if it
          seems you’ve hit your limit or if you’re not sure what it is in your
          organization.

          Why does the Relationships view of my Contacts list include people I
          never added to my list, and how do I get them off of it?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every contact you interact with via Microsoft Office, whether in your
          Skype4B contacts list or not, has a "default" relationship with you.
          Your “unlisted” contacts (that is, those who are not included in your
          Skype4B contacts list) don’t get displayed in either the Groups view
          or the Status view. But the Relationships view shows all the contacts
          on your Skype4B contacts list plus any unlisted contacts whom you’ve
          assigned a non-default privacy relationship. To remove any of these
          “unlisted” contacts from your Relationships view, right-click on the
          contact, click Change Privacy Relationship, and select Auto-assign
          Relationship.

          What does the red star or asterisk next to a contact's status mean?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The red asterisk next to a contact's status indicates that he or she
          has turned on the Out of Office reply in Outlook.

        Questions about Instant Messaging (IMs)

        <h3>
          How can I make the IM alerts more prominent so I don’t miss incoming
          IM requests?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unless you have set notifications so alerts will not display when you
          are in Do not Disturb mode, Skype4B will by default always send you
          both a visual alert (in the lower right corner of your display) and a
          sound alert whenever someone tries to reach you via IM. Just the same,
          you may occasionally fail to notice an IM request. This is especially
          likely when you are using multiple screens or when your alert volume
          is too low or off. To help ensure that your IM alerts are noticeable,
          try the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Set your display so Skype4B is always in the foreground when it
          starts. To do this, click the Options button, click Tools, and then
          click Always on Top.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Drag the slider on the Program Events display panel down to the
          Microsoft Skype4B 2010 listings.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Click Incoming Instant Message. The Sounds display at bottom of the
          window should read COMMUNICATOR_iminvite.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Now click the drop-down arrow next to it and sample some of the
          other sounds on the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Once you find a sound you want to use for incoming IM alerts, click
          Apply. (The Program Events display panel should now read Incoming
          Instant Message and the Sounds panel should display the name of
          whatever .wav file you’ve selected.)
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Click OK. (You can also record your own .wav file for this purpose,
          and then browse to that file to select it as your IM alert.)
        </p>
        <h3>
          Where can I find previous IM conversations, records of Skype4B calls,
          or IM requests I may have missed?
        </h3>
        <p>
          By default, if you are using Microsoft Outlook, Skype4B saves all
          incoming and outgoing conversations in your Outlook Conversation
          History folder, so you can review previous conversations. To see a
          list of recent Skype4B interactions added to this folder:
        </p>
        <p>
          - On the Skype4B main window, click the Conversations tab above the
          Search input area.
        </p>
        <p>- Click the View More in Outlook link at bottom of the window.</p>

          follow these steps:
        </h3>
        <p>
          1. Verify that you are using Microsoft Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In the Skype4B main window, click the Options button, and then
          click Personal.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Click the Save instant message conversations in my email
          Conversation History folder button, and then click OK.
        </p>
        <h3>What types of information can I copy and paste into an IM?</h3>
        <p>
          You can copy and paste text, tables, and links from other Microsoft
          Office products directly into a Skype4B IM. You can't paste images
          (screenshots, photos, etc.) directly into an IM, but you can paste
          them onto a whiteboard and display them to others. To do this:
        </p>
        <p>
          - In the IM conversation window, click Share, click New Whiteboard,
          click the Insert Image button at bottom of the Whiteboard, and then
          browse to and double-click on the image you want to display.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I use spellchecking in my Skype4B IMs?</h3>
        <p>
          No, Skype4B doesn’t currently have built-in spellchecking, in keeping
          with its intended use as a quick and informal communications method.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I add customized emoticons to my Skype4B IMs?</h3>
        <p>
          No, you can’t. But there are 80 emoticons in the Skype4B assortment.
          To see them, click the emoticon icon to the right of the text input
          area on the conversation window.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I change fonts in my IMs?</h3>
        <p>
          To change the font, style, size or color for a specific IM you are
          writing:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Type your message, highlight the text you want to change, click the
          Font button in the IM composing area, and then make your selections in
          the Font window.
        </p>
        <p>To change the default font details for all the IMs you send:</p>
        <p>
          From the Skype4B main window, click the Options button, click General,
          click Change Font, and then select a default font, font style, font
          size, and font color. Then click OK. These selections will apply only
          to IM messages you send, not to those you receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          To change the default font details for incoming IMs as well (to
          improve their legibility, for example):
        </p>
        <p>
          - From the Skype4B main window, click the Options button, click
          General, click Change Font, and then select a default font, font
          style, font size, and font color. Then select the Apply settings to
          incoming messages checkbox, and then click OK.
        </p>
        <h3>
          set an alert to notify me as soon as a particular contact becomes
          available?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the Skype4B main window, in your Contacts list, right-click a
          contact, and then click Tag for Status Change Alerts.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I disable IM alert sounds?</h3>
        <p>
          You can instruct Skype4B not to play your audible IM and/or phone
          alerts whenever your presence says Do not Disturb, and you can further
          instruct Skype4B to notify you only if the person trying to contact
          you is a member of your workgroup with that privacy relationship. To
          view and adjust these settings:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Click the Options button in the Skype4B main window, and then click
          Alerts.
        </p>
        <p>To turn the audible alerts off altogether:</p>
        <p>
          - Click the Options button in the Skype4B main window, click Ringtones
          and Sounds, and then clear the Play sounds in Skype4B (including
          ringtones for incoming alerts and IM alerts) check box.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I recall (block the delivery of) an IM?</h3>
        <p>
          No, an instant message can’t be recalled once you hit the Enter key to
          send it.
        </p>
        Questions about presence
        <h3>How do I get rid of the Out of Office note in Skype4B?</h3>
        <p>
          If your Skype4B account is synced via Microsoft Exchange Server to
          your Outlook calendar, an out-of-office message appears in Skype4B
          after you turn on the Out of Office reply in Microsoft Outlook. To get
          rid of the out-of-office message display in Skype4B, you need to turn
          off the Out of Office reply in Outlook:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Click the File tab in Outlook, and then click the Turn off button in
          the Automatic Replies panel.
        </p>
        <h3>Why can’t I set my presence status to "Appear Away"?</h3>
        <p>
          Your organization may have turned off the Appear Away status option,
          on the grounds that it can interfere with the reliability of the
          presence indicator. If a lot of people use this status constantly,
          presence in general won’t mean much. Keep in mind that you can also
          use privacy relationships to avoid interruptions. For example, if you
          don’t want to be disturbed by most people, you can set your status as
          Do Not Disturb and then grant certain people permission to interrupt
          you by adding them to your Workgroup.
        </p>
        <h3>What do the settings on the Status options window mean?</h3>
        <p>
          On the Status options window you can change the number of minutes that
          elapse before your presence status changes to Inactive and Away, if
          you don’t want to use the default settings. You can also have Skype4B
          automatically detect when you are sharing information from this
          computer. Skype4B will set your status as Presenting and block others
          from sending messages to you during that time. To set these presence
          status options:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In the Skype4B main window, click the Options button, and then
          click Status.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Click the up and down arrows to specify the number of minutes
          before your presence status changes to Inactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Click the up and down arrows to specify the number of minutes
          before your presence status changes to Away.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Click the appropriate button to control general status (override
          default settings or accept them), and then click OK.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Select the checkboxes labeled Show me as Do Not Disturb when I
          present my desktop and Show me as Do Not Disturb when my monitor is
          duplicated to let others know not to interrupt you when you are giving
          a presentation or otherwise collaborating online from your
          Skype4B-enabled computer.
        </p>
        <h3>How can I give people more information about my status?</h3>
        <p>
          Although the presence states in Skype4B are pre-set, you can always
          write a personal note at the top of the Skype4B main window to provide
          more details about where you are and what you’re doing. Just click the
          note display area and type over the note that’s currently displayed.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What do the various presence states mean, which ones are set
          automatically, and which ones can I set myself?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Here’s a table that describes the contact presence states that people
          can see, what each state means, and how it gets set.

        Questions About Skype Login

        <h3>Can two users login to Skype on the same machine?</h3>
        <p>
          No, Skype for Business can only support one logged in user from one
          machine.
        </p>
        Questions about audio and video

        <h3>Can I use Skype4B to make a call?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a call with Skype4B:</p>
        <p>- Skype4B call</p>
        <p>
          A Skype4B call is made from your computer to someone else’s computer
          who is also using Skype4B (computer audio).
        </p>
        <p>
          - A Skype4B call placed to a contact rings all their devices that are
          enabled for Skype4B, such as desktop and laptop computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          - You can also make Skype4B calls to federated contacts. A federated
          relationship with other companies is just a virtual alliance that lets
          you add users from other companies to your contacts lists, send them
          IMs, make audio, video and conference calls, and exchange presence
          information.
        </p>
        <h3>My Skype calls get disconnected every 30-40 seconds.</h3>
        <p>
          Ensure only one user is logged in to the machine. Restart the
          computer, and login again to resolve the disconnection issue.
        </p>

        <h3>Why am I having audio problems?</h3>
        <p>
          If there’s a problem, a notification is displayed in the conversation
          window or the Skype4B main window. You can click the notification for
          more information or suggested solutions. For example:
        </p>
        <img src="./img/faq3.png" alt="faq3" />
        <p>If you’re not getting sound, check that:</p>
        <p>
          - Your speakers are turned on, both in Skype4B and your computer, and
          the speaker volume is high.
        </p>
        <p>
          - The device you’re using is selected on the DEVICES tab, (pause on
          the phone/mic icon and click the DEVICES tab).
        </p>
        Questions about Online Meeting

        <h3>Can I restrict access to my Skype4B meetings with a password?</h3>
        <p>
          No, but there's a similar option. Skype4B meetings you schedule are
          not publicly listed, so normally only people you send an invite to
          will have the link to join your meeting. If you'd like to further
          restrict access, Skype4B offers a "lobby" feature that places
          attendees who join your meeting into a holding area until you admit
          them to the meeting.
        </p>
        <p>1- From meeting invitation click Meeting Options icon</p>
        <img src="./img/faq4.png" alt="faq4" />
        <p>2- Select A new Meeting Space:</p>
        <img src="./img/faq5.png" alt="faq5" />
        <p>
          - If you need change this meeting to private and only inviter the
          attend change "These People don't have to wait in the lobby: People I
          invite from my company"
        </p>
